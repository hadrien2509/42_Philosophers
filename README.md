Sure, I can create a comprehensive and engaging README for the "/Volumes/Storage/goinfre/hgeissle/42_Philosophers" repository. Here it is:

## Overview

The 42 Philosophers project is a multi-threaded application that simulates the classic Dining Philosophers problem. It is designed to showcase the understanding of thread synchronization, mutex locks, and resource management. The project aims to provide a practical implementation of the Dining Philosophers problem, which is a classic example of a synchronization problem in computer science.

## How to Run the Project

To run the 42 Philosophers project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/42_Philosophers.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd 42_Philosophers`
3. Compile the project: `make`
4. Run the executable with the required arguments:

```
./philo [number_of_philosophers] [time_to_die] [time_to_eat] [time_to_sleep] [number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat] (optional)
```

For example:

```
./philo 5 800 200 200
```

This command will run the simulation with 5 philosophers, where each philosopher must eat every 800 milliseconds, takes 200 milliseconds to eat, and sleeps for 200 milliseconds.

- `.git/`: Git repository directory.

- `philo/not_libft/`: A directory containing custom implementations of common string and number manipulation functions.

## Main Features

- **Multi-threaded Simulation**: The project simulates the Dining Philosophers problem using multiple threads, one for each philosopher.
- **Synchronization and Mutex Locks**: Mutex locks are used to ensure that philosophers do not access shared resources (forks) simultaneously, preventing deadlocks and race conditions.
- **Resource Management**: The application manages the allocation and deallocation of resources (forks) efficiently to prevent memory leaks.
- **Argument Parsing**: The program accepts command-line arguments to configure the simulation parameters, such as the number of philosophers, time to eat, time to sleep, and time to die.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling is implemented to gracefully handle invalid arguments and runtime errors.

## Front-end Logic

The 42 Philosophers project does not have a traditional front-end user interface. However, it utilizes the terminal to display the simulation progress and status updates. The output is formatted to provide a clear and concise representation of the philosophers' actions, such as taking forks, eating, sleeping, and thinking.

## Back-end Logic

The back-end logic of the 42 Philosophers project is implemented in C and follows a multi-threaded architecture. Each philosopher is represented by a separate thread, and the main thread manages the creation, synchronization, and termination of these philosopher threads.

The project utilizes mutex locks to ensure that philosophers do not access shared resources (forks) simultaneously, preventing deadlocks and race conditions. The application manages the allocation and deallocation of resources (forks) efficiently to prevent memory leaks.

The project also includes custom implementations of common string and number manipulation functions in the `not_libft` directory, which are used throughout the codebase.
